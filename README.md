## Project Description

This assignment provided us with an HTML and CSS file that needed to be refactored. The goal for refactoring this webpage means to clean up the HTML code and to ensure that the webpage was accessible. 

In addition to refactoring, I added comments before various elements within the html document. Overall I found myself removing divs as the entire webpage was full of them. And instead I replaced them with header, footer, section, articles elements instead. This allowed me to keep the webpage look the same, keep all its functions the same but define the areas of the webpage better so that when changes are needed - you will not have to sort through all the divs to find the banner to change.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```
## Helpful Hints

The main goal of refactoring is to make changes to clean up the code, you DO NOT want to change the website itself in any way.

ARTICLE -defines an article

ASIDE -defines content aside from the page content

FIGURE -specifies a self-contained content

SECTION -defines a section in a document
